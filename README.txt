This is an e-Transport Marketplace created for Ubuntu Linux as a project for my Software Design and Implementation module. 
It was created using C++ for the backend and QMake for its user interface 

To run the program:
1. Import the SDI_Project.sql file into the database to initially setup the database
2. Change the connection information in the mainwindow.cpp file at lines 134, 135, 136, 137
3. The prgram should run after these steps and a green text saying "conected" should appear at the bottom right of the screen
